# Project "SpringSecurityDemo"

The "SpringSecurityDemo" project is a demonstration of implementing security features in a web application using Spring Security.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase the capabilities of Spring Security for managing authentication and authorization in a Java web application. It provides a foundation for securing various resources, such as endpoints, pages, and data, within the application.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: The project demonstrates the implementation of user authentication using different authentication mechanisms, such as form-based login, OAuth, or LDAP.
- **Authorization and Access Control**: Spring Security enables fine-grained access control to protect resources based on user roles and permissions. This project illustrates the configuration of access rules and restrictions.
- **Password Management**: The application showcases secure password storage using hashing and salting techniques provided by Spring Security.
- **Session Management**: Spring Security offers session management capabilities, such as controlling session timeouts, invalidating sessions, and handling concurrent sessions. This project demonstrates the configuration of session management features.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**: Spring Security provides protection against CSRF attacks. This project exemplifies the usage of CSRF tokens to mitigate this vulnerability.
- **Integration with Other Security Frameworks**: The project demonstrates how to integrate Spring Security with other security frameworks, such as Spring Boot Actuator or Spring Session.

## Getting Started

To run the "SpringSecurityDemo" project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SpringSecurityDemo.git
   ```

2. Build the project using Maven:

   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Configuration

The project's security configuration can be found in the `SecurityConfig` class. This is where you can customize authentication providers, configure access rules, and enable or disable specific security features.

For more advanced customization, please refer to the official Spring Security documentation.

## Documentation

Additional documentation and guides for using Spring Security can be found in the [official Spring Security documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs).
